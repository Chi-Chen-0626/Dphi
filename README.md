## Project 1. Eye gender classifier 
Automatic gender classification from face images has been a popular topic for some time. To achieve accurate classification, to extract key features from the dataset is crucial when using traditional machine learning models. However, with deep learning models, feature extraction becomes automatic. The unpredictable and hidden features explored by the deep neural networks have largely increased the classification performance. 
In this project, I trained varies convolutional neural network (CNN) models to do gender classification based on eye images. Specifically, I compared a naive CNN model with a pre-trained CNN model, VGG-19. 


## Project 2. Sarcasm detection 
Sarcasm is the use of language that normally signifies the opposite in order to mock or convey contempt [Oxford dictionary]. The aim of sarcasm detection is to detemine whether a sentence is a sarcastic or non-sarcastic. 
In this project, I used natural language processing (NLP) technique to classify news headlines. The dataset consists about 44262 text data points.
